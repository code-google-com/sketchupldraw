Inspired by and based on Jim Foltz' su2ldraw script: http://sites.google.com/site/jimfoltz02/su2ldraw

Current focus is on exporting basic Sketchup geometry to LDraw format. Exports triangular and quadrilateral faces as well as edge lines. Sketchup "soft" and "smooth" edge properties are used to differentiate regular edge lines, conditional edge lines, and edge lines that should not be exported.
